#CS_RIO on CS: GO

This is the update of the classic map **cs_rio** for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

This fan made project aims to convert the original cs_rio to the Source Engine to be played in CS:GO, keeping the same level geometry, textures and resources (sounds, skyboxes, etc.) matching the original map.

Set in a favela of Rio de Janeiro, this is Brazil's most famous Counter-Strike map. It was developed in 2001 by [Matalone] (http://www.mataleone.com/) for CS 1.6 and became very popular accross brazilian lan houses at the time.

##Latest version

Download is available at the [Releases] (https://github.com/fred-azevedo/cs_rio/releases) section. Currently there is no version published on Steam Workshop because the map is not 100% finished.

##Contribute
The Hammer map source file is available at the `src/maps` folder of this project. You can grab it, view how the map is built and suggest improvements.

##Credits

All map credits goes to the original designers [Mataleone & Crocodilo] (http://www.mataleone.com/php/main.php?page=map&map=cs_rio), the real minds behind cs_rio.
